# Security

We take security very seriously at Opencontent. We welcome any peer review of our 100% open source code to ensure that public authorities that adopt our software are ever compromised or hacked.

## Where should I report security issues?
In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues privately. Please use our vulnerability disclosure program at Hacker One to provide details and repro steps and we will respond ASAP. If you prefer not to use Hacker One, email us directly at security@opencontent.it with details and repro steps. Security issues always take precedence over bug fixes and feature work.
